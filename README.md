# Music Key Trainer
#### A simple training tool to determine the key of a chord progression.

# Background

A small tool that I developed to become more familiar with Vue3 and GitHub deployment. 
The program selects a MIDI chord progression from a list and plays it. 
The goal is to then guess the scale of the MIDI file.

I got the MIDI files from https://github.com/ldrolez/free-midi-chords/releases.

# Key Takeaways
### Vue3 and the new Composition API
I had only worked with Vue2 before. With this project, I took my first steps with the composition API and Vue3.
### GitHub Deployment
Getting familiar with GitHub Actions and deploying to GitHub Pages.
